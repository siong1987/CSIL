CSIL Project
============

How this works?
---------------

1. Every time you make a request to the frontpage of http://csil.heroku.com, 
   the backend will try to SSH into CSIL from another server.
2. If the backend server manages to SSH into CSIL server, it means that CSIL 
   is not down for that current request.
3. If the backend server timeouts within 5 seconds, it means that CSIL is down.
